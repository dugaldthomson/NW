# High-Level Implementation Guide

This document provides a high-level guide on how to implement the proposed architecture for the ship noise analysis project.

## 1. Set up the Database

First, you will need to set up a PostgreSQL database. You can do this on your local machine or on a cloud platform, such as AWS or Google Cloud.

Once you have set up the database, you can use the `ingest_data.py` script to create the required tables.

```bash
python ingest_data.py
```

## 2. Ingest the Data

Next, you will need to ingest the data from the various files into the database. You will need to modify the `ingest_data.py` script to include the correct paths to your data files and to parse the files correctly.

### CPA Data

You will need to modify the `ingest_cpa_data` function to read the `CPA.xlsx` file and insert the data into the `ships` and `cpas` tables. You will need to make sure that the column names in the Excel file match the column names in the database tables.

### AIS Data

You will need to modify the `ingest_ais_data` function to read the `AIS.mat` file and insert the data into the `ais_data` table. You will need to figure out how to parse the `.mat` file correctly. You may need to use a different library or a different approach to read the data, as `scipy.io.loadmat` is not working as expected.

### Hydrophone Data

You will need to modify the `ingest_hydrophone_data` function to read the `arrays_lat-long.mat` file and insert the data into the `hydrophones` table. You will need to figure out how to parse the calibration data and store it in the `calibration_data` column.

### Acoustic Data

You will need to modify the `ingest_acoustic_data` function to read the `.h5` files and insert the data into the `acoustic_data` table. You will need to figure out the structure of the `.h5` files and how to extract the data and timestamps.

## 3. Implement the Core Data Processing Logic

Once you have ingested the data, you can start implementing the core data processing logic in the `processing.py` script.

### `calc_dist`

You will need to replace the placeholder implementation of the `calc_dist` function with a proper implementation that calculates the distance and azimuth between the ship and the hydrophones. You can use a library like `geopy` to perform these calculations.

### Other Functions

You may need to implement other functions in the `processing.py` script, depending on the specific requirements of your analysis.

## 4. Perform the Analysis and Visualization

Finally, you can use the `analysis.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis and visualization. You will need to modify the notebook to query the database, perform the analysis, and generate the required plots.

You can use the `pandas` library to query the database and manipulate the data, and you can use the `matplotlib` library to generate the plots.
