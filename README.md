# NW: Marine Acoustic Signal Processing and Analysis Toolkit

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive MATLAB-based toolkit for marine acoustic signal processing and analysis, implementing the methodologies developed for the Northern Watch Project and published in Thomson & Barclay (2025). The toolkit specializes in ship-radiated noise directionality analysis using multi-channel underwater acoustic recordings from 48-element hydrophone arrays.

Originally developed for Arctic marine surveillance applications in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, this toolkit provides advanced capabilities for characterizing the horizontal radiation patterns of vessel-generated underwater noise, with particular focus on both broadband and tonal acoustic components.

## Main Function: windows_48ch

The core function of this toolkit is `windows_48ch` (located in `SPL_windows/windows_48Ch.mlx`), which implements the signal processing methodology described in Thomson & Barclay (2025). This function serves as the primary analysis engine for processing 48-channel acoustic array data and:

- **Processes multi-channel acoustic recordings** from 48-element bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays
- **Performs high-resolution spectral analysis** with 0.5-Hz frequency resolution using 2048-point FFT
- **Calculates source level directivity patterns** with 3-second time averaging for both broadband (10-600 Hz) and narrowband tonal components
- **Implements tonal tracking algorithms** for engine harmonics, propeller blade rates, and auxiliary machinery signatures
- **Integrates AIS positioning data** for precise vessel bearing and range calculations during closest point of approach (CPA) events
- **Applies propagation loss corrections** using geometric spreading models validated against full-wave acoustic modeling
- **Generates probability density estimates** of source levels as a function of ship aspect angle

The function is specifically designed for analyzing ship-radiated underwater noise directionality using large-aperture hydrophone arrays, providing unprecedented spatial resolution for characterizing acoustic signatures from marine vessels in both Arctic and temperate environments.
